# Compiler flags:
# /EHsc: Enables C++ exception handling.
# /std:c++17: Specifies C++17 standard.
# /W4: Sets warning level to 4 (high level of warnings).
# /MD: Links with the multi-threaded DLL version of the C runtime library (MSVCRT.LIB).
# /D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS: Suppresses warnings for older, less secure C runtime functions.
# /Zi: Generates complete debugging information (optional, remove for release builds).
